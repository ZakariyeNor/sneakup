- The base template contains the HTML structure and loads CSS/JS libraries needed for responsive behavior.

This ensures all header and footer components remain consistent and maintain functionality across all pages and device sizes.

## Database Design

### Data Model

Auto-generating Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD)

I have used Auto-generating Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD) to document my database models, making it easier to visualize relationships between different models in my Django project. By utilizing the django-extensions and pygraphviz libraries, I was able to automatically generate an ERD representing the structure of my database. This approach streamlines the process of creating an up-to-date diagram, especially as the project evolves. Below are the steps I followed to generate the ERD, which can be included in your project‚Äôs documentation for better understanding and future reference.

I have used `pygraphviz` and `django-extensions` to auto-generate an ERD.

The steps taken were as follows:
- In the terminal: `sudo apt update`
- then: `sudo apt-get install python3-dev graphviz libgraphviz-dev pkg-config`
- then type `Y` to proceed
- then: `pip3 install django-extensions pygraphviz`
- in my `settings.py` file, I added the following to my `INSTALLED_APPS`:
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'django_extensions',
    ...
]
```
- back in the terminal: `python3 manage.py graph_models -a -o erd.png`
- drag the new `erd.png` file into my `documentation/` folder
- removed `'django_extensions',` from my `INSTALLED_APPS`
- finally, in the terminal: `pip3 uninstall django-extensions pygraphviz -y`

## üßë‚Äçüíª Agile Development & Process

### GitHub Projects

[GitHub Projects](https://www.github.com/ZakariyeNor/sneakup/the_shoe) served as an Agile tool for this project. Through it, EPICs, User Stories, issues/bugs, and Milestone tasks were planned, then subsequently tracked on a regular basis using the Kanban project board.

![The shoe project](documentation/agile/gi_projects.png)

### GitHub Issues

[GitHub Issues](https://www.github.com/ZakariyeNor/sneakup/issues) served as an another Agile tool. There, I managed my User Stories and Milestone tasks, and tracked any issues/bugs.

| Link | Screenshot |
| --- | --- |
| [![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/ZakariyeNor/sneakup)](https://www.github.com/ZakariyeNor/sneakup/issues) | ![Issues](documentation/agile/gi_issues.png) |

- SMS confirmation and customer management features are currently in the backlog and were not delivered in this iteration. They are planned for future development.

### MoSCoW Prioritization

I've decomposed my Epics into User Stories for prioritizing and implementing them. Using this approach, I was able to apply "MoSCow" prioritization and labels to my User Stories within the Issues tab.

- **Must Have**: guaranteed to be delivered - required to Pass the project (*max ~60% of stories*)
- **Should Have**: adds significant value, but not vital (*~20% of stories*)
- **Could Have**: has small impact if left out (*~15% of stories*)
- **Won't Have**: not a priority for this iteration - future features (*the rest ~5% of stories*)

### GitHub Project Board

Tasks are tracked using:
- Epics
- Issues
- Milestones
- Labels (e.g., `must`, `should`, `won't`)

## ‚úÖ Testing

 For all testing, you can find them [TESTING.md](documentation/test_documentation/) folder.

> Or for each 
 > [Manual Testing](documentation/test_documentation/MANUAL_TESTING.md),
 > [Front-end Tests](documentation/test_documentation/front_end_testing/FRONT_END_VALIDATION.md),
 > [Back-end Tests](documentation/test_documentation/back_end_testing/BACK_END_VALIDATION.md) and 
 > [PyTests](documentation/test_documentation/back_end_testing/PYTEST.md),

- | [![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/ChatGPT-grey?logo=openai&logoColor=75A99C)](https://chat.openai.com) |
- I used to output html templates, to validate in HTML validator without templatetags,
- I used to test, views, functions, models, urls, admin and forms to make the testing process faster.
- I used to document testing files to make the process of documenting faster
- I used to test the template logic and user accessibility.
- I used HTML validator for html testing, CSS validator for css testing and JSHINT for javascript testing.

## üöÄ Deployment

### Live Site

The live deployed application can be found deployed on [SneakUp on Heroku](https://sneakup-904b7ffd186f.herokuapp.com/)

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), then finally, click **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set your environment variables to match your private `env.py` file.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `CLOUDINARY_NAME` | https://cloudinary.com/ |
| `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY` | https://cloudinary.com/ |
| `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` | https://cloudinary.com/ |
| `DB_URL` | https://www.postgresql.org/ |
| `SECRET_KEY`          | Django secret key (keep this confidential)                                          |
| `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD` | Email service password (used for sending emails)                                    |
| `EMAIL_HOST_USER`     | Email address used to send transactional emails (e.g., `noreply@sneakup.com`)       |
| `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL`  | Default from-email address used in Django settings                                  |
| `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY`   | Public Stripe key for frontend use                                                  |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`   | Secret Stripe key for backend operations                                            |
| `STRIPE_WH_SECRET`    | Stripe webhook signing secret for validating Stripe events                          |


Heroku needs some additional files in order to deploy properly.

- [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)
- [Procfile](Procfile)

You can install this project's **[requirements.txt](requirements.txt)** (*where applicable*) using:

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:

- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **[Procfile](Procfile)** can be created with the following command:

- `echo web: gunicorn sneakup.wsgi > Procfile`

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (*replace `app_name` with your app name*)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Cloudinary API

This project uses the [Cloudinary API](https://cloudinary.com) to store media assets online, due to the fact that Heroku doesn't persist this type of data.

To obtain your own Cloudinary API key, create an account and log in.

- For "Primary Interest", you can choose **Programmable Media for image and video API**.
- *Optional*: edit your assigned cloud name to something more memorable.
- On your Cloudinary Dashboard, you can copy your **API Environment Variable**.
- Be sure to remove the leading `CLOUDINARY_URL=` as part of the API **value**; this is the **key**.
    - `cloudinary://123456789012345:AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStuVwXyZa@1a2b3c4d5)`
- This will go into your own `env.py` file, and Heroku Config Vars, using the **key** of `CLOUDINARY_URL`.

### PostgreSQL

This project uses a [Code Institute PostgreSQL Database](https://dbs.ci-dbs.net) for the Relational Database with Django.

To obtain my own Postgres Database from Code Institute, I followed these steps:

- Submitted my email address to the CI PostgreSQL Database link above.
- An email was sent to me with my new Postgres Database.
- The Database connection string will resemble something like this:
    - `postgres://<db_username>:<db_password>@<db_host_url>/<db_name>`
- You can use the above URL with Django; simply paste it into your `env.py` file and Heroku Config Vars as `DATABASE_URL`.

### WhiteNoise

This project uses the [WhiteNoise](https://whitenoise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to aid with static files temporarily hosted on the live Heroku site.

To include WhiteNoise in your own projects:

- Install the latest WhiteNoise package:
    - `pip install whitenoise`
- Update the `requirements.txt` file with the newly installed package:
    - `pip freeze --local > requirements.txt`
- Edit your `settings.py` file and add WhiteNoise to the `MIDDLEWARE` list, above all other middleware (apart from Django‚Äôs "SecurityMiddleware"):

```python
# settings.py

MIDDLEWARE = [
    'django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware',
    'whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware',
    # any additional middleware
]
```


### Local Development

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file.

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level, and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps.

Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "any-random-secret-key")
os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "user-inserts-own-postgres-database-url")
os.environ.setdefault("CLOUDINARY_URL", "user-inserts-own-cloudinary-url")  # only if using Cloudinary

# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
```

Once the project is cloned or forked, in order to run it locally, you'll need to follow these steps:

- Start the Django app: `python3 manage.py runserver`
- Stop the app once it's loaded: `CTRL+C` (*Windows/Linux*) or `‚åò+C` (*Mac*)
- Make any necessary migrations: `python3 manage.py makemigrations --dry-run` then `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
- Migrate the data to the database: `python3 manage.py migrate --plan` then `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Load fixtures (*if applicable*): `python3 manage.py loaddata file-name.json` (*repeat for each file*)
- Everything should be ready now, so run the Django app again: `python3 manage.py runserver`

If you'd like to backup your database models, use the following command for each model you'd like to create a fixture for:

- `python3 manage.py dumpdata your-model > your-model.json`
- *repeat this action for each model you wish to backup*
- **NOTE**: You should never make a backup of the default *admin* or *users* data with confidential information.
