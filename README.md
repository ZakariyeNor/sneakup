### Notes on `base.html` Integration

- The base template contains the HTML structure and loads CSS/JS libraries needed for responsive behavior.
- Navigation menus and footer are embedded within the base template using Django templating language.
- User-specific content such as profile links and admin features are conditionally rendered based on `user.is_authenticated` and `user.is_staff`.
- Mobile and desktop views adapt automatically via Bootstrap's responsive classes and custom JavaScript interactions included in the base template.

This ensures all header and footer components remain consistent and maintain functionality across all pages and device sizes.

## Current Model Justification

#### Checkout / Orders
**Order & OrderLineItem**  
- `Order` stores customer details, shipping information, and order totals.  
- `OrderLineItem` links each item in an order to a specific `Product` and optionally a size.  
- **Reasoning:**  
  - `OrderLineItem → Order` and `OrderLineItem → Product` use `ForeignKey`, following relational DB principles.  
  - `Profile → Order` via `ForeignKey` links orders to users.  
  - Totals (`order_total`, `vat`, `grand_total`) are stored for performance, though they could be calculated dynamically.  
  - `product_size` is stored as a string for flexibility; a `ProductVariant` model could be added in future for normalization.

#### Products / Category
**Product & Category**  
- `Product` is linked to `Category` via `ForeignKey`.  
- `size` is stored as a JSONField and `free_size` boolean allows flexibility for products without sizes.  
- **Reasoning:**  
  - Flexible storage allows quick implementation of size options.  
  - Ratings are stored in `Product` for simplicity, though a `ProductRating` table could track ratings per user in the future.  
  - Featured sections (LaunchedProducts, NewArrivals, BestSelling) are curated manually for staff control rather than fully automated.

#### Profiles / User
**Profile**  
- One-to-one link with `User` ensures each user has a profile.  
- Default address fields are included in `Profile` for quick access.  
- **Reasoning:**  
  - Simplifies user checkout experience.  
  - In the future, multiple addresses could be normalized into an `Address` table.  

#### Pages / Content Models
**PrivacyPolicy, ReturnsPolicy, FAQs, ContactMessage, AboutPageHero, OurMission, NewArrivals, OurMaterials, BestSelling, LaunchedProducts**  
- Separate models allow admin-controlled content and dynamic updates.  
- **Reasoning:**  
  - Allows staff to manually curate featured content rather than relying solely on automated metrics.  
  - **LaunchedProducts / NewArrivals / BestSelling:**  
    - Staff selects which products to feature.  
    - Future enhancement: staff may use aggregated customer reviews or sales data to guide selections.  
  - **FAQs:** Can be grouped by category in the future.  
  - **ContactMessage:** `order_number` is stored as a string for simplicity; a ForeignKey could be added later.

#### Newsletter / Marketing
**NewsletterSubscriber**  
- Stores email addresses for newsletter subscription.  
- **Reasoning:**  
  - Simple model for marketing outreach.  
  - Future enhancements may include segmentation, preferences, and automated notifications.

#### Overall Justification
The current models balance **database normalization** and **practical business needs**:  
- Checkout and product models support relational design and performance optimization.  
- Content models allow staff to curate featured products and information, with potential for future automation and normalization.  
- Profiles and newsletter models provide flexibility for user data and marketing, while maintaining simplicity in the database schema.  

**Future Consideration:**  
- Staff decisions can be guided by customer reviews, product ratings, and engagement metrics.  
- Featured sections could eventually be dynamically derived from the `Product` catalog and `OrderLineItem` sales data while still allowing manual override.  


## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

### Future Enhancements for Database Models

#### Checkout / Orders
* **Order totals:** Consider calculating `order_total`, `vat`, `delivery`, and `grand_total` dynamically instead of storing in the database to adhere strictly to normalization principles. Stored totals may remain for performance optimization.
* **OrderLineItem product sizes:** Implement a `ProductVariant` model to handle sizes, SKU, and price instead of storing sizes as a string. This allows proper relational design.
* **Customer reviews integration:** Link customer feedback to products so staff can make informed decisions on featured products.

#### Products / Category
* **Product Variants:** Replace `size` JSONField or string with a `ProductVariant` table, storing one size per variant, price, SKU, and stock.
* **Ratings:** Move `rating` from `Product` to a separate `ProductRating` model to track ratings per user, enabling more precise metrics.
* **Featured sections automation:** Derive `LaunchedProducts`, `NewArrivals`, and `BestSelling` dynamically from `Product` and `OrderLineItem` data in future updates, while still allowing manual override by staff.

#### Profiles / User
* **Address normalization:** Create an `Address` table linked to `Profile` to support multiple addresses per user instead of storing default address fields in the profile.
* **Extended user data:** Add user preferences, wishlists, or loyalty points for future personalization features.

#### Pages / Content Models
* **FAQs:** Add optional `Category` or `Page` ForeignKey to organize questions by topic.
* **ContactMessage:** Link `order_number` to the `Order` model instead of storing as a string.
* **About page content:** In the future, dynamically query products for sections like NewArrivals or BestSelling while still allowing manual staff selection.
* **Customer-driven decisions:** Staff can use aggregated user reviews, ratings, or engagement metrics to curate content in `LaunchedProducts`, `NewArrivals`, and `BestSelling`.

#### Newsletter / Marketing
* **Subscriber segmentation:** Add user preferences, interests, or purchase history to enable targeted email campaigns.
* **Automation:** Use subscription data to automatically send updates when new products launch or for personalized recommendations.

#### Overall DB Design Enhancements
* Implement optional ForeignKey links between content models and `Product` to allow hybrid manual/automatic curation.
* Consider using `signals` or scheduled tasks to update featured sections dynamically based on sales or engagement.
* Maintain audit logs for staff changes to featured content to track decisions for analytics and future reporting.

## Database Design

### Data Model

Auto-generating Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD)

I have used Auto-generating Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD) to document my database models, making it easier to visualize relationships between different models in my Django project. By utilizing the django-extensions and pygraphviz libraries, I was able to automatically generate an ERD representing the structure of my database. This approach streamlines the process of creating an up-to-date diagram, especially as the project evolves. Below are the steps I followed to generate the ERD, which can be included in your project’s documentation for better understanding and future reference.

I have used `pygraphviz` and `django-extensions` to auto-generate an ERD.

The steps taken were as follows:
- In the terminal: `sudo apt update`
- then: `sudo apt-get install python3-dev graphviz libgraphviz-dev pkg-config`
- then type `Y` to proceed
- then: `pip3 install django-extensions pygraphviz`
- in my `settings.py` file, I added the following to my `INSTALLED_APPS`:
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'django_extensions',
    ...
]
```
- back in the terminal: `python3 manage.py graph_models -a -o erd.png`
- drag the new `erd.png` file into my `documentation/` folder
- removed `'django_extensions',` from my `INSTALLED_APPS`
- finally, in the terminal: `pip3 uninstall django-extensions pygraphviz -y`

![E.R.D](documentation/%20advanced-erd.png)

### Justification for Pages Models (LaunchedProducts, NewArrivals, BestSelling)

Although these sections could be fully derived from the `Product` model using `launch_date`, `created_at`, or sales data from `OrderLineItem`, we chose to implement separate models (`LaunchedProducts`, `NewArrivals`, `BestSelling`) to allow staff full control over featured content. This ensures business flexibility and supports marketing decisions that automated queries alone cannot capture.

**Reasons for this approach:**

* **BestSelling:** Staff can feature products as “best selling” even if they haven’t sold the most, allowing promotional strategies.
* **NewArrivals:** Staff can highlight new products they have sourced or discovered, even if not yet fully processed in the catalog.
* **LaunchedProducts:** Staff can curate which launches to emphasize, providing a curated experience for customers.

**Future improvements:**

* Staff decisions will increasingly incorporate customer reviews and user experience metrics, ensuring that highlighted products align with user satisfaction.
* Optional normalization can be added later, e.g., linking `LaunchedProducts` or `BestSelling` to the `Product` model for automated queries while maintaining manual override.

This approach balances database normalization principles with practical business needs and ensures that the admin retains control over the site’s featured content, while leaving room for future data-driven enhancements.

## 🧑‍💻 Agile Development & Process

### GitHub Projects

[GitHub Projects](https://www.github.com/ZakariyeNor/sneakup/the_shoe) served as an Agile tool for this project. Through it, EPICs, User Stories, issues/bugs, and Milestone tasks were planned, then subsequently tracked on a regular basis using the Kanban project board.

![The shoe project](documentation/agile/gi_projects.png)

### GitHub Issues

[GitHub Issues](https://www.github.com/ZakariyeNor/sneakup/issues) served as an another Agile tool. There, I managed my User Stories and Milestone tasks, and tracked any issues/bugs.

| Link | Screenshot |
| --- | --- |
| [![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/ZakariyeNor/sneakup)](https://www.github.com/ZakariyeNor/sneakup/issues) | ![Issues](documentation/agile/gi_issues.png) |

- SMS confirmation and customer management features are currently in the backlog and were not delivered in this iteration. They are planned for future development.

### MoSCoW Prioritization

I've decomposed my Epics into User Stories for prioritizing and implementing them. Using this approach, I was able to apply "MoSCow" prioritization and labels to my User Stories within the Issues tab.

- **Must Have**: guaranteed to be delivered - required to Pass the project (*max ~60% of stories*)
- **Should Have**: adds significant value, but not vital (*~20% of stories*)
- **Could Have**: has small impact if left out (*~15% of stories*)
- **Won't Have**: not a priority for this iteration - future features (*the rest ~5% of stories*)

### GitHub Project Board

Tasks are tracked using:
- Epics
- Issues
- Milestones
- Labels (e.g., `must`, `should`, `won't`)

- I used to output html templates, to validate in HTML validator without templatetags,
- I used to test, views, functions, models, urls, admin and forms to make the testing process faster.
- I used to document testing files to make the process of documenting faster
- I used to test the template logic and user accessibility.
- I used HTML validator for html testing, CSS validator for css testing and JSHINT for javascript testing.

## 🚀 Deployment

### Live Site

The live deployed application can be found deployed on [SneakUp on Heroku](https://sneakup-904b7ffd186f.herokuapp.com/)

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), then finally, click **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set your environment variables to match your private `env.py` file.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `CLOUDINARY_NAME` | https://cloudinary.com/ |
| `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY` | https://cloudinary.com/ |
| `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` | https://cloudinary.com/ |
| `DB_URL` | https://www.postgresql.org/ |
| `SECRET_KEY`          | Django secret key (keep this confidential)                                          |
| `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD` | Email service password (used for sending emails)                                    |
| `EMAIL_HOST_USER`     | Email address used to send transactional emails (e.g., `noreply@sneakup.com`)       |
| `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL`  | Default from-email address used in Django settings                                  |
| `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY`   | Public Stripe key for frontend use                                                  |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`   | Secret Stripe key for backend operations                                            |
| `STRIPE_WH_SECRET`    | Stripe webhook signing secret for validating Stripe events                          |


Heroku needs some additional files in order to deploy properly.

- [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)
- [Procfile](Procfile)

You can install this project's **[requirements.txt](requirements.txt)** (*where applicable*) using:

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:

- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **[Procfile](Procfile)** can be created with the following command:

- `echo web: gunicorn sneakup.wsgi > Procfile`

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (*replace `app_name` with your app name*)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Cloudinary API

This project uses the [Cloudinary API](https://cloudinary.com) to store media assets online, due to the fact that Heroku doesn't persist this type of data.

To obtain your own Cloudinary API key, create an account and log in.

- For "Primary Interest", you can choose **Programmable Media for image and video API**.
- *Optional*: edit your assigned cloud name to something more memorable.
- On your Cloudinary Dashboard, you can copy your **API Environment Variable**.
- Be sure to remove the leading `CLOUDINARY_URL=` as part of the API **value**; this is the **key**.
    - `cloudinary://123456789012345:AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStuVwXyZa@1a2b3c4d5)`
- This will go into your own `env.py` file, and Heroku Config Vars, using the **key** of `CLOUDINARY_URL`.

### PostgreSQL

This project uses a [Code Institute PostgreSQL Database](https://dbs.ci-dbs.net) for the Relational Database with Django.

To obtain my own Postgres Database from Code Institute, I followed these steps:

- Submitted my email address to the CI PostgreSQL Database link above.
- An email was sent to me with my new Postgres Database.
- The Database connection string will resemble something like this:
    - `postgres://<db_username>:<db_password>@<db_host_url>/<db_name>`
- You can use the above URL with Django; simply paste it into your `env.py` file and Heroku Config Vars as `DATABASE_URL`.

### WhiteNoise

This project uses the [WhiteNoise](https://whitenoise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to aid with static files temporarily hosted on the live Heroku site.

To include WhiteNoise in your own projects:

- Install the latest WhiteNoise package:
    - `pip install whitenoise`
- Update the `requirements.txt` file with the newly installed package:
    - `pip freeze --local > requirements.txt`
- Edit your `settings.py` file and add WhiteNoise to the `MIDDLEWARE` list, above all other middleware (apart from Django’s "SecurityMiddleware"):

```python
# settings.py

MIDDLEWARE = [
    'django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware',
    'whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware',
    # any additional middleware
]
```


### Local Development

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file.

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level, and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps.

Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "any-random-secret-key")
os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "user-inserts-own-postgres-database-url")
os.environ.setdefault("CLOUDINARY_URL", "user-inserts-own-cloudinary-url")  # only if using Cloudinary

# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
```

Once the project is cloned or forked, in order to run it locally, you'll need to follow these steps:

- Start the Django app: `python3 manage.py runserver`
- Stop the app once it's loaded: `CTRL+C` (*Windows/Linux*) or `⌘+C` (*Mac*)
- Make any necessary migrations: `python3 manage.py makemigrations --dry-run` then `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
- Migrate the data to the database: `python3 manage.py migrate --plan` then `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Load fixtures (*if applicable*): `python3 manage.py loaddata file-name.json` (*repeat for each file*)
- Everything should be ready now, so run the Django app again: `python3 manage.py runserver`

If you'd like to backup your database models, use the following command for each model you'd like to create a fixture for:

- `python3 manage.py dumpdata your-model > your-model.json`
- *repeat this action for each model you wish to backup*
- **NOTE**: You should never make a backup of the default *admin* or *users* data with confidential information.

#### Cloning

You can clone the repository by following these steps:

1. Go to the [GitHub repository](https://www.github.com/ZakariyeNor/sneakup).
2. Locate and click on the green "Code" button at the very top, above the commits and files.
