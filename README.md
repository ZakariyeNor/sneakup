### Notes on `base.html` Integration

- The base template contains the HTML structure and loads CSS/JS libraries needed for responsive behavior.
- Navigation menus and footer are embedded within the base template using Django templating language.
- User-specific content such as profile links and admin features are conditionally rendered based on `user.is_authenticated` and `user.is_staff`.
- Mobile and desktop views adapt automatically via Bootstrap's responsive classes and custom JavaScript interactions included in the base template.

This ensures all header and footer components remain consistent and maintain functionality across all pages and device sizes.
